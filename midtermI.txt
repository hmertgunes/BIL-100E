Tuesday 8 November midterm I
IT will be assumed that the first two lines of your code are:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Do not rewrite thse commands and you will not have to memorise these commands


Recuremce relations
factorial
a_n=f(a_{n-1},a_{n-1}) term n of the sequence is given as function of two previous terms. Compute the sequence.
Compute the series of exp ,cos ,sin (the mathematical formula will be given)

Writing reading from a file and converts the strings read from  the file into desired form (float ,integer extra)

numpy array manipulations 
extracting a subararay starting from istart to istop (without including istop) with stride nstride
linspace ,arange what is the meaning of linspace(a,b,n ,False)?
extract a subarray meeting a particular condition (Example:from an 
array of integers extract na array of even integers without using for loop)
Note 11%2 is 1(remainder in the division
What are the signs =  and ==? 
Function plotting

Functions:
The scope of a variable (local and global variables)
study week7.py carefully
optional variables:
	def fsum(x,y=0)#default value of y is 0
		return x+y
	print(fum(2))#displays  2 because the optional argument y is not provided.
	#y takes then the default value 0
	print(fum(2,1))#displays  3 because the optional argument y is now 1.
	

 How to pass a function as argument  to an other  function (week7.py line 65
 where function fcircle has been passed to integrate as first argument)
 
 the meaning of f(*l)
 example:
	def fsum(x,y):
		return x+y
	print(fsum(1,2))# will display 3
	#or
	l=[1,2]
	print(fsum(*l))# will display 3
	#or
	l=[2]
	print(fsum(1,*l))# will display 3
	This latter use fsum(x,*l) will be usful in integrating function of several variables 
with respect to its first variable using def integration2(f,a,b,N,arg=[]). See  line74 of week7.py where 
function latitude_surface_area has been integrated with respect to tis first variable and the second
argument is set to R/2.
